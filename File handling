File Handling in OOP

What is File Handling?

File handling in C++ allows us to store and retrieve data from files. It is essential for reading/writing data persistently beyond program execution.

Key Features of File Handling:

Persistent Storage: Stores data permanently.

Uses Streams: ifstream for reading, ofstream for writing, fstream for both.

Handles Large Data Efficiently: Manages large data without storing it in memory.

Can Be Used with OOP: Helps in saving/loading objects.

File Handling in C++

C++ provides fstream library for file operations:

#include <fstream>

Opening and Closing a File

Files should always be closed after operations to avoid data corruption.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream outFile("example.txt"); // Open file for writing
    if (outFile.is_open()) {
        outFile << "Hello, file handling in C++!";
        outFile.close(); // Close the file
    }
    return 0;
}

Writing to a File

We use ofstream to write data to a file.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream file("data.txt");
    file << "This is a line written to a file.";
    file.close();
    return 0;
}

Reading from a File

We use ifstream to read data from a file.

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream file("data.txt");
    string line;
    while (getline(file, line)) {
        cout << line << endl;
    }
    file.close();
    return 0;
}

File Handling with Classes

We can integrate file handling into classes for better data management.

Example: Writing and Reading an Object

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    void saveToFile() {
        ofstream file("student.txt");
        file << name << endl;
        file << age << endl;
        file.close();
    }

    void readFromFile() {
        ifstream file("student.txt");
        getline(file, name);
        file >> age;
        file.close();
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s1;
    s1.name = "Alice";
    s1.age = 20;
    s1.saveToFile();

    Student s2;
    s2.readFromFile();
    cout << "Name: " << s2.name << ", Age: " << s2.age << endl;
    return 0;
}

Summary

File handling stores and retrieves data from files.

ofstream writes data, ifstream reads data, fstream does both.

Always close files after use.

File handling can be integrated into OOP for object storage.
