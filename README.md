Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

# What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." Objects are instances of classes that contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. OOP is widely used in modern programming as it helps in organizing code efficiently and making it reusable.

# Key Features of OOP:

Encapsulation - Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class).

Abstraction - Hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary parts of an object.

Inheritance - Allowing one class to derive properties and behavior from another class.

Polymorphism - The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.

# Why Use OOP?

OOP is beneficial because it:

Enhances code reusability through inheritance.

Improves maintainability by organizing code into objects.

Provides modularity making code easier to debug and extend.

Supports real-world modeling as everything is represented as objects.
# Details
# 1. Class and Object

Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects.

Object: An instance of a class that has its own values for the attributes.


# 2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent unintended modifications. It is implemented using access specifiers:

Private: Accessible only within the same class.

Public: Accessible from outside the class.

Protected: Accessible within the same class and derived classes.

# 3. Abstraction

Abstraction allows hiding the implementation details of a class and only showing the necessary functionalities. It can be implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.

# 4. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a new class to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class. It promotes code reuse and reduces redundancy.

# 5. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.
